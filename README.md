# DAST

A Distributed anonymous Social tracking post COVID-19

We are unaware on how the world will change after the coronavirus outbreak, but we know for sure that something will or already had change. **The social interaction**

Currently there is the concept of **"Social Distancing"**, as an attempt to minimize the chances of spreading the virus. Nevertheless, *personally*, I can't imagine our current society
keep evolving without heavy social interaction (not necessarily all touching each other ðŸ˜‹).

**The Situation**: "Social Distancing post COVID-19"

**The challenge**: "Minimize the effect of social distancing to allow the society return to normal ASAP"

#### The angle
According to some researchers, politicians, tweets, news and common sense: **The spreading of the virus is inevitable**, at some point a big chunk of the population will get infected.

According to this, I've pictured a future where the main effort for controlling the virus would be massive and on-time identification of hotspots. Just like the chinese government is doing.

#### The proposed solution:
An anonymous and  distributed, *private*-blockchain based, social tracking tool. Which will enable more secure real-life social interactions by anonymously tracking our social interactions and broadcasting tool to ensure on-time COVID-19 testing.

As March of 2020, the chinese government is currently imposing the use of a mobile app, which tracks all your geographical, economic and who knows what else interactions.
Which given the current situation, is actually necessary to keep tracking and avoid new outbreaks of the virus and allowing the society to continue with their normal life.

Nevertheless, in the western world, we are keen to protect our privacy, How can we get the same benefits as the chinese people but maintain our western/free society perks.
The proposed solution will give some of those benefits as social interaction and geographical tracking as warning broadcasting, while maintaining our privacy and ensuring transparent and un-centralized data.

The User flow
* *Randy* downloads and install the DAST app, which will create his Digital Anonymous Id (DAID)
* *Randy* continues with his normal life, when he engages in a social interaction will need to do a **social check-in**
  * This **social check-in** will emit a transaction with the interacted-DAI, geolocation and a timestamp
* *Randy* gets diagnosed for COVID-19, the doctor will trigger a **social-broadcasting** with his DAI and a timestamp
  * This **social-broadcasting** will issue a notification to all the users who were had a **social check-in** with *Randy* in the last 4 days (or wathever),
  asking them to perform a COVID test.
